# Today I learned,
        -in order to get good at something, you have to suck at it first



This one was a lot of fun to build. At times getting stuck but through trial, error and determination to finish I was able to get it working.

I also found the software engineer's secret weapon......   When you get stuck with no way out, go outside or go do something else. That 'Eureka!!!' moment will always come when you least expect it. 

I personally would just take my dogs for a walk. A LOT OF WALKS if I'm being honest, but I would always find a way or the answer would pop in my head urging me to run home to test my theory out.

This journey into discovering my passion for coding has been very exciting so far. Two and a half years into it and I'm doing things I didn't think I was capable of when I first sat down and looked at a page full of letters and symbols not having the slightest clue what any of it meant.

I'm sure my dogs don't mind either..

Thanks for reading!
